## ChemProt Challenge ##

Relation extraction between **chemical and proteins pairs only**. The dataset has annotations of 10 categories of relations termed as CPR:1 to CPR:10 but evaluates only CPR:3 to CPR:6 and CPR:9.

BioCreative 6 also known as ChemProt is a database of annotated and predicted chemical-protein interactions. Chemicalâ€“protein interactions (CPIs) play important roles in metabolism and the regulation of biological processes. The information contained in CPIs is essential toward understanding mechanisms of diseases and developing therapeutic drugs.
